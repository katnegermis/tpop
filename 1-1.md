Question
========
Comment on the choice of names and values in the following code.

```
#define TRUE 0
#define FALSE 1

if ((ch = getchar()) == EOF)
    not_eof = FALSE;

Answer
======
The value of `TRUE` and `FALSE` are swapped, and therefore are not intuitive to use.

The variable `not_eof` is poorly named. It would be much clearer to use a non-negated name.

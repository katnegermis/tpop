Question
========
What is wrong with this excerpt?

```
int read(int *ip) {
    scanf("&d", ip);
    return *ip;
}
    ...
insert(&graph[vert], read(&val), read(&ch));
```

Answer

It is not at all clear from the name what `read` does. A solution would be to call it readint instead.

Another, arguably more grave, problem is that the order of evaluation of function arguments is undefined. This means that arguments may not be evaluated left to right, and that the values inserted with `insert` may be swapped (semantically), i.e. the rightmost `read` (the value of `ch`) may be evaluated first, letting the user believe that he is inputting the value of `val`.

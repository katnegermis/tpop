Question
========
List all the different outputs this could produce with various orders of evaluation

```
n = 1;
printf(%d %d\n", n++, n++);
```

Answer
======
We know that the order of evaluation of increments in C (`n++`, `++n`) is undefined within a single expression, so any order may happen.

Possible results:

1. 1, 2
3. 2, 1
4. 1, 1
